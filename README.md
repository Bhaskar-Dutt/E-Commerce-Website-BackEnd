  
## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or Eclipse
3. Make sure you are in the `JtProject` directory
4. Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file (check the [Database](#database) section below for more info)
5. Run the project (by running the `main` method in `JtSpringProjectApplication.java`)
6. Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser!
   * If you run the `basedata.sql` script on the database, you can log in with the following credentials as admin; otherwise, you'll have to create an admin user in the database manually:
     * Username: `admin`
     * Password: `123`
   * Log in as a normal user:
     * Username: `lisa`
     * Password: `765`
